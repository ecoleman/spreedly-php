Spreedly PHP API
Luke Ehresman - http://luke.ehresman.org

This set of classes provides a convenienet wrapper around the Spreedly
API (http://spreedly.com).  Instead of dealing with HTTP directly with
CURL, you can use these objects to handle everything for you.  Some
examples are provided, but for some really good examples, check out
the unit tests.
